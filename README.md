## Description

We know art has been around since thousands of years. Just recently we started asking if artists, paintings leave a sort of "fingerprint".

Neural Style Transfer (NST), as seen, merges two images: a "content" image and a "style" image, to create a synthetic new image, which combines the content of the former, with the styilistic features of the latter.
